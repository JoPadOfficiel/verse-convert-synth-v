# Verse

Verse is a desktop application for macOS and Windows that converts karaoke,
MIDI and score files into Synthesizer V projects without inventing lyrics or
notes. Its complete export also keeps the original file and adds a real,
audible full-score reference mix.

## Why this exists

Synthesizer V Studio 1.x does not reliably import lyrics from MIDI. Depending
on the import/conversion path, users can end up with `la la la`, altered
Western text, missing lyrics or instrumental notes represented as silent vocal
tracks.

Verse uses only evidence present in the source:

- a genuine source lyric such as `la` remains `la`;
- an untexted note remains untexted;
- generic MIDI Text is metadata, not a lyric;
- a normal MIDI file without lyrics succeeds with zero generated words;
- no fallback pitch, lyric, track, instrument or audio is fabricated.

## Supported input formats

| Format | Extensions | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Karaoke MIDI | `.kar` | Qualified Soft Karaoke text and MIDI lyric events |
| Standard MIDI | `.mid`, `.midi` | Lyric-free MIDI is valid |
| MusicXML | `.mxl`, `.xml`, `.musicxml` | Parts, voices, lyric lanes and unpitched percussion are inventoried |
| MuseScore | `.mscz`, `.mscx` | Native MuseScore score parsing |

## Complete preservation bundle

The primary export is a new `.versebundle` directory:

```text
Song.versebundle/
├── manifest.json
├── preservation.json
├── source/
│   └── Song.mscz
├── project/
│   └── Song.svp
└── audio/
    └── full-score.wav
```

- `source/` contains a byte-identical copy of the input.
- `preservation.json` records the disposition of inventoried source items.
- `manifest.json` contains hashes, sizes, renderer identity and audio metadata.
- `project/*.svp` contains only evidence-backed vocal-note projections plus a
  Synthesizer V instrumental-audio track.
- `audio/full-score.wav` is rendered from the original file by MuseScore
  Studio 4 and referenced by the SVP as real instrumental audio.

The bundle is staged and committed transactionally. Verse never silently
falls back to an audio-less bundle and never overwrites an existing bundle.

“Source-faithful” means that the original bytes and a disposition ledger are
preserved. It does not mean every notation or MIDI concept has a lossless SVP
equivalent.

## Audio renderer and important limits

Complete bundle export requires a user-installed **MuseScore Studio 4**.
Configure its executable in Settings or let Verse try to detect it. MuseScore
is not bundled with Verse.

MuseScore renders the **original full score**. This keeps piano, instruments
and percussion audible, but the WAV is a reference mix, not a clean
vocal-removed accompaniment stem. Renderer absence, timeout, invalid output or
write failure blocks the bundle and leaves no fake or partial result.

The secondary “Vocals `.svp`” action writes only editable vocal notes. It does
not contain piano or instrumental audio; use the complete bundle when those
parts must be audible.

## Lyrics, tracks and voices

- MusicXML and MuseScore lyric ownership stays attached to the source
  note/voice/lane.
- Soft Karaoke text is accepted only after its karaoke profile is qualified.
- Generic MIDI Text is preserved as metadata.
- Continuation markers are emitted only from source lyric-extension evidence.
- Unpitched percussion and data not representable in SVP remain in the source,
  ledger and full-score audio.
- A manual “Vocal SVP” override changes only the requested export
  representation. It does not change the reported source role and does not
  invent words.

Verse does not embed or select a commercial Synthesizer V voice database.
After opening the project, assign a compatible voice to every vocal track.
Without that assignment Synthesizer V cannot sing the notes. The instrumental
WAV does not need a voice database.

## Usage

1. Install Verse from the
   [Releases page](https://github.com/JoPadOfficiel/verse-convert-synth-v/releases)
   (`.dmg` on macOS, `.exe` or `.msi` on Windows).
2. Install MuseScore Studio 4 if you want complete bundles.
3. Drop one or more supported files into Verse.
4. Expand a file to inspect source roles, lyric status, export representation
   and warnings.
5. Optionally change a pitched track’s “Vocal SVP” export choice.
6. Click **Bundle** (or **Export all bundles**) for the complete result.
7. Open `project/*.svp` from inside the bundle in Synthesizer V and assign a
   voice database to the vocal tracks.

The selected lyric language configures the Synthesizer V vocal database
language. It never translates, normalizes or phoneticizes source text.

### Opening an unsigned build

Released binaries are not code-signed with paid Apple/Microsoft developer
certificates, so the operating system may ask for one-time confirmation.

**Windows:** on the SmartScreen dialog, select **More info > Run anyway**.

**macOS:** if Gatekeeper reports that Verse is damaged, remove the download
quarantine flag:

```sh
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Verse.app"
```

Adjust the path if Verse is installed elsewhere.

## Development

Prerequisites:

- Rust stable;
- Node.js 18 or later;
- MuseScore Studio 4 for real audio-rendering gates.

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
npm run tauri dev

cd src-tauri
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked
```

Optional local gates for the two reported real-world regressions use:

```sh
VERSE_MSCZ_GATE="/path/to/score.mscz" \
VERSE_MXL_GATE="/path/to/score.mxl" \
cargo test --locked --test source_fidelity
```

### Architecture

- `src-tauri/src/engine/` parses MIDI, MusicXML and MuseScore into a
  provenance-rich source model and projects evidence-backed vocal material.
- `src-tauri/src/renderer.rs` discovers and bounds MuseScore Studio 4
  rendering.
- `src-tauri/src/bundle.rs` creates the transactional preservation bundle,
  validates WAV output and writes manifests/hashes.
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` exposes validated Tauri commands and structured
  errors.
- `src/` is the React interface for analysis, renderer settings, overrides and
  bundle/vocal-only export.

The SVP serializer currently targets project format version 113. Time is
expressed in blicks; one quarter note is 705,600,000 blicks.
